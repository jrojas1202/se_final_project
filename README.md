**Why Use TanStack Query?**

I implemented TanStack Query in this project because it allowed for smoother transition for the pagination function and it was critical for the search filter bar. During the building of this project I ran into an issue where the search bar would hard crash the site when filtering through the over 1000 plus Pokemon. TanStack Query solved this probelm because it allowed me to cache all fetched Pokemon data so when the user is searching through the many Pokemon, the site would not need to refetch that data it could just grab it out of the cache and display it again to the user, resulting in a much better user experience and not crashing the server by making so many api calls.

**Future Project Imporovements**

I want to continue to build on this project by adding dedicated pages for the different moves and ablities each pokemon can have. With a description for each move and abilty and what Pokemon can learn/have those moves and abilities. I aslo want include information about the pokemon games and the anime aswell. I want to add more infromation about each individual Pokemon on thier profile page. I want to add in the evolution line for each Pokemon, if they have one, and add information about what games the Pokemon are featured in.
